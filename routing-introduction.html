<h2>Routing Introduction</h2>
<p>Now that we have our models, we can now define our routing. Routing
defines what URLs do what in your application and all of the
configuration is kept in one place: <em>config/routes.rb</em>.</p>

<p>This file will already have 2 lines in it already, along with around
30 commented out lines followed by two uncommented lines. The first two
lines after <span class="term">ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|</span> will look like:</p>

<p><b>Lines 2 &amp; 3 of config/routes.rb</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>users</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resource</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>session</span>
</pre><p></p>

<p>These two lines are defining the routes and methods for the users
and session controller and was written into our routes.rb from our
restful_authentication generator. The <span class="term">map.resource :session </span>
is flawed, as it's generated a SessionController but by default
map.resource :session goes to SessionsController, but restful
authentication generated SessionController (<em>app/controllers/session_controller.rb</em>) instead. To fix this, we'll suffix map.resource :session with the option of :controller =&gt; "session" so that it looks like:</p>

<p></p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>session</span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>session<span class="String">"</span></span>
</pre><p></p>

<p>The next thirty lines are examples of how to use the routes file covering:
</p><ul>
<li>Regular routing</li>
<li>Named routing</li>
<li>Resource routing</li>
<li>Resource routing with options</li>
<li>Resource routing with sub resources</li>
<li>Resource routing within namespaces</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>You can delete these lines if you like.</p>

<p>The final two lines define the final routes for our application.
These are the last resort routes and generally will not be called in
our application, but we'll leave them there for now, as they may come
in handy later on.</p>

<p>We're going to define some named routes in order to give us prettier URLs for when the user wants to login, signup or logout.</p>

<p><b>New lines in our routes.rb file, somewhere near the top.</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">connect</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>login<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>session<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>new<span class="String">"</span></span>
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> map.<span class="Entity">connect</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>signup<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>users<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>new<span class="String">"</span></span>
<span class="line-numbers">   3 </span> map.<span class="Entity">connect</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>logout<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>session<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>destroy<span class="String">"</span></span>
</pre><p></p>

<p>We're able to pass in methods on the map object that don't exist
thanks to the magic of method_missing. method_missing is the last
method to get called in the method chain when all else fails and this
can be overwritten, as it has been in this case. These three lines will
map /login, /signup and /logout to their respective controllers and
actions specified after the method call.</p>

<p>We're going to now define our resource routing. The way we do this is we call <span class="term">map.resources</span> and then pass in what we want to make a resource:</p>

<p><b>Underneath map.logout … in config/routes.rb</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>forums</span> <span class="Keyword">do </span>|<span class="Variable">forum</span>|
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span>   forum.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>topics</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   3 </span> <span class="Keyword">end</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   4 </span> 
<span class="line-numbers">   5 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>topics</span> <span class="Keyword">do </span>|<span class="Variable">topic</span>|
<span class="line-numbers">   6 </span>   topic.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>posts</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   7 </span> <span class="Keyword">end</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   8 </span> 
<span class="line-numbers">   9 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>posts</span>
</pre><p></p>

<p>This will give us access to using methods to generate URLs such as <em>/forums</em> to go to our index action in our forums (forums_path) controller, <em>/forums/1</em> to go to the show action (forum_path([id or forum object]) and <em>/forums/1/edit</em> to go to edit action (edit_forum_path([id or forum object]). We've called <span class="term">do |forum|</span> at the end of this to start a new block with <span class="term">forum</span> as our object. We call <span class="term">resources</span> on <span class="term">forum</span> in order to nest the topic resources inside of forums, so we can get URLs like <em>/forums/1/topics/2</em> to get the topic with the id of 2 (<span class="term">params[:id]</span>) inside the forum with the id of 1 (<span class="term">params[:forum_id]</span>)</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but we don't have our edit action located at <em>/forums/1/edit</em>,
we've put it into a namespaced controller so we should also have a
namespaced route to point to the correct location. To do this we call <span class="term">map.namespace(:admin)</span> before calling <span class="term">#resources</span>, like this:</p>

<p><b>config/routes.rb</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">namespace</span>(<span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>admin</span>) <span class="Keyword">do </span>|<span class="Variable">admin</span>|
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> admin.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>forums</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   3 </span> <span class="Keyword">end</span>
</pre><p></p>

<p>What this has done is made routes exactly like the above, but it's
prefixed them with /admin/ so that we can now go to our namespaced
controllers rather than their non-namespaced counterparts.</p>

<p>Now to set up a default route ,often referred to as root, for people navigating to our domain we have to use a method called <span class="term">#root</span> on the map object, like this:</p>

<p><b>config/routes.rb</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">root</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>forums<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>index<span class="String">"</span></span>
</pre><p></p>

<p>If you start your server now by opening a console window and typing <span class="term">mongrel_rails start</span>
in the application's root directory (also referred to as RAILS_ROOT).
This will start a single Mongrel server in development mode which will
serve our application for as long as it's running. Development mode
means it will reload all the code in the app/ folder every time a
request comes in, as compared to production in which it will load it
only once. Opening your browser, go to http://0.0.0.0:3000 and you'll
see the default <em>Ruby on Rails: Welcome aboard</em> screen. This is
just the index.html file located in the public folder. You can delete
this file and I recommend you do if you want to continue.

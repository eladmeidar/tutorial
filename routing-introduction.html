                <h2>Routing Introduction</h2>
                <p>Now that we have our models, we can now define our routing. Routing
                defines what URLs do what in your application and all of the
                configuration is kept in one place: <em>config/routes.rb</em>.</p>

                <p>This file will already have 2 lines in it already, along with around
                30 commented out lines followed by two uncommented lines. The first two
                lines after <span class="term">ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|</span> will look like:</p>

                <p><b>Lines 2 &amp; 3 of config/routes.rb</b>
                </p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>users</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resource</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>session</span></pre><p></p>

                <p>These two lines are defining the routes and methods for the users
                and session controller and was written into our routes.rb from our
                restful_authentication generator. The <span class="term">map.resource :session </span>
                is flawed, as it's generated a SessionController but by default
                map.resource :session goes to SessionsController, but restful
                authentication generated SessionController (<em>app/controllers/session_controller.rb</em>) instead. To fix this, we'll suffix map.resource :session with the option of :controller =&gt; "session" so that it looks like:</p>

<pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>session</span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>session<span class="String">"</span></span></pre><p></p>

                <p>The next thirty lines are examples of how to use the routes file covering:
                </p><ul>
                <li>Regular routing</li>
                <li>Named routing</li>
                <li>Resource routing</li>
                <li>Resource routing with options</li>
                <li>Resource routing with sub resources</li>
                <li>Resource routing within namespaces</li>
                </ul><p></p>

                <p>You can delete these lines if you like.</p>

                <p>The final two lines define the final routes for our application.
                These are the last resort routes and generally will not be called in
                our application, but we'll leave them there for now, as they may come
                in handy later on.</p>

                <p>We're going to define some named routes in order to give us prettier URLs for when the user wants to login, signup or logout.</p>

                <p><b>New lines in our routes.rb file, somewhere near the top.</b>
                </p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">connect</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>login<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>session<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>new<span class="String">"</span></span>
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> map.<span class="Entity">connect</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>signup<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>users<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>new<span class="String">"</span></span>
<span class="line-numbers">   3 </span> map.<span class="Entity">connect</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>logout<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>session<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>destroy<span class="String">"</span></span>
</pre><p></p>

                <p>We're able to pass in methods on the map object that don't exist
                thanks to the magic of method_missing. method_missing is the last
                method to get called in the method chain when all else fails and this
                can be overwritten, as it has been in this case. These three lines will
                map /login, /signup and /logout to their respective controllers and
                actions specified after the method call.</p>

                <p>We're going to now define our resource routing. The way we do this is we call <span class="term">map.resources</span> and then pass in what we want to make a resource:</p>

                <p><b>Underneath map.logout â€¦ in config/routes.rb</b>
                </p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>forums</span></pre><p></p>

                <p>This will give us access to using methods to generate URLs such as
                /forums to go to our index action in our forums (forums_path)
                controller, /forums/1 to go to the show action (forum_path([id or forum
                object]) and /forums/1/edit to go to edit action (edit_forum_path([id
                or forum object]).</p>

                <p>This is all well and good, but we don't have our edit action located
                at /forums/1/edit, we've put it into a namespaced controller so we
                should also have a namespaced route to point to the correct location.
                To do this we call <span class="term">map.namespace(:admin)</span> before calling <span class="term">#resources</span>, like this:</p>

                <p><b>config/routes.rb</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">namespace</span>(<span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>admin</span>) <span class="Keyword">do </span>|<span class="Variable">admin</span>|
<span class="line-numbers">   2 </span> admin.<span class="Entity">resources</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>forums</span>
<span class="line-numbers">   3 </span> <span class="Keyword">end</span></pre><p></p>

                <p>What this has done is made routes exactly like the above, but it's
                prefixed them with /admin/ so that we can now go to our namespaced
                controllers rather than their non-namespaced counterparts.</p>

                <p>Now to set up a default route ,often referred to as root, for people navigating to our domain we have to use a method called <span class="term">#root</span> on the map object, like this:</p>

                <p><b>config/routes.rb</b>
</p><pre class="twilight"><span class="line-numbers">   1 </span> map.<span class="Entity">root</span> <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>controller</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>forums<span class="String">"</span></span>, <span class="Constant"><span class="Constant">:</span>action</span> =&gt; <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>index<span class="String">"</span></span>
</pre><p></p>

                <p>I feel this is better placed at the very top of our routes file,
                because of how the routes file is processed. Rails will go through each
                entry in the routes file until it finds one that matches what the URL
                is, and then it will act on that. If our root route is at the top then
                it will be matched first reducing the time it takes for the application
                to process the home page, but only by a few milliseconds.</p>

                <p>If you start your server now by opening a console window and typing <span class="term">mongrel_rails start</span>
                in the application's root directory (also referred to as RAILS_ROOT).
                This will start a single Mongrel server in development mode which will
                serve our application for as long as it's running. Development mode
                means it will reload all the code in the app/ folder every time a
                request comes in, as compared to production in which it will load it
                only once. Opening your browser, go to http://localhost:3000 and you'll
                see the default <em>Ruby on Rails: Welcome aboard</em> screen. This is
                just the index.html file located in the public folder. You can delete
                this file and I recommend you do if you want to continue. Refreshing
                the page will give you a nice big fat <em>Template is missing </em> error, which we're about to fix.
